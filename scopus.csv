These are particularly interesting for use in pervasive systems of small devices with limited communication and computational capabilities. In particular, we assume that items are tagged with smart tags (such as passive RFIDs), storing aggregate information about the visiting patterns of users that interacted with them in the past. Users access and modify information stored in smart tags transparently, by smart reader devices that are already available on commercial mobile phones. Smart readers use private information about previous behavior of the user and aggregate information retrieved from smart tags to recommend new items that are more likely to meet user expectations. Note that we do not assume any transmission capabilities between smart tags: Information exchange among them is mediated by users' collective and unpredictable navigation patterns. Our algorithms do not require any explicit interaction among users and can be easily and efficiently implemented. We analyze their theoretical behavior and assess their performance in practice, by simulation on both synthetic and real, publicly available data sets. We also compare the performance of our fully decentralized solutions with that of state-of-the-art centralized strategies. © 2010 Springer-Verlag London Limited.","Collaborative filtering; Decentralized recommendations; Resource constrained devices","Aggregates; Behavioral research; Collaborative filtering techniques; Commercial mobile phones; Computational capability; Decentralized recommendations; Experimental analysis; Limited communication; Resourceconstrained devices; Transmission capability; Collaborative filtering","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80052032046"

To support economic transactions in this setting, and to pave the way for the implementation of decentralized algorithmic governance powered by smart contracts, the adoption of the blockchain has been proposed both in scientific literature and in actual projects. The blockchain technology promises a decentralized payment system independent of (and possibly cheaper than) conventional electronic payment systems. However, there are a number of aspects that need to be considered for an effective IoT–blockchain integration. In this review paper, we start from a number of real IoT projects and applications that (may) take advantage of blockchain technology to support economic transactions. We provide a reasoned review of several architectural choices in light of typical requirements of those applications and discuss their impact on transaction throughput, latency, costs, limits on ecosystem growth, and so on. We also provide a survey of additional financial tools that a blockchain can potentially bring to an IoT ecosystem, with their architectural impact. In the end, we observe that there are very few examples of IoT projects that fully exploit the potential of the blockchain. We conclude with a discussion of open problems and future research directions to make blockchain adoption easier and more effective for supporting an IoT economy. © 2022 by the authors.

We categorize DTN protocols according to their use of the three techniques that are the key elements of our reference architecture: queue management, forwarding and replication. Queue management orders and manages the messages in the node's buffer; forwarding selects the messages to be delivered when there is a contact; and finally, replication bounds the number of replicas in the network. Contrary to most previous papers, where either only qualitative comparisons have been presented or only a single category of protocols has been analyzed, in our work, we discuss the results of our experimental activity on many of the DTN protocols in the literature. Our results, which have been obtained both using synthetic and real mobility traces, show that an effective combination of the proposed techniques can significantly improve the performance of the protocols in terms of delivery ratio, overhead and delay. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Delay-tolerant networks; Experimentation; Performance evaluation; Routing protocols","","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028302866"

Current approaches in digital trials entail that private user data are provisioned to the trial investigator that is considered a trusted party. The aim of this paper is to present the technical requirements and the research challenges to secure the flow and control of personal data and to protect the interests of all the involved parties during the first phases of a clinical trial, namely the characterization of the potential patients and their possible recruitment.

However, accessing sensitive medical data from diverse sources is highly restricted since improper use, unsafe storage, or data leakage could violate a person’s privacy. This work uses a Federated Learning (FL) privacy-preserving methodology to train AI models over heterogeneous sets of high-definition ECG from 12-lead sensor arrays collected from six heterogeneous sources. We evaluated the capacity of the resulting models to achieve equivalent performance compared to state-of-the-art models trained in a Centralized Learning (CL) fashion. Moreover, we assessed the performance of our solution over Independent and Identical distributed (IID) and Non-IID federated data. Our methodology involves machine learning techniques based on Deep Neural Networks and Long-Short-Term Memory models. It has a robust data preprocessing pipeline with feature engineering, selection, and data balancing techniques.

One of the challenges that FL faces is when the clients' data is not independent and identically distributed (non-IID). It is, therefore, crucial to quantify how non-IID data impacts performance. However, due to the limited number of federated data available, it is not easy to carry out real-world simulations. In this work, we propose for the first time 1) the Hist-Dirichlet-based and Min-Size-Dirichlet methods for partitioning data into multiple nodes using the features and quantity distribution and the Dirichlet distribution. We use the 2) Jensen-Shannon and Hellinger distances for quantifying the degree of IID data. Moreover, we implemented 3) state-of-the-art partitioning methods based on the labels' distribution across clients. All our proposals are open-source in a library called FedArtML, publicly available on PyPI. It facilitates research on cross-silo and cross-device FL, allowing a systematic and controlled partition of centralized datasets using the label, features, and quantity skewness. To demonstrate the value of our proposed methods and the robustness of FedArtML, we experimented in the ECG arrhythmia detection field with Physionet 2020 data. Our results demonstrate that our tool generates federated datasets for multi-client model training and accurately measures client distribution heterogeneity. Our approach achieves 48% higher non-IID-ness than existing feature skew methods, providing more granularity. Furthermore, we validate our simulated federated datasets against real-world data, revealing only a 2% F1-Score difference, affirming the method's real-life applicability.  © 2013 IEEE.","Centralized datasets; clients heterogeneity; federated datasets; federated learning; heterogeneity metrics; machine learning; non-IID-ness","Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Centralised; Centralized dataset; Client’s heterogeneity; Distributed database; Federated dataset; Federated learning; Heterogeneity metric; Machine-learning; Non-IID-ness; Systematic; Data privacy","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195379558"

In this highly fragmented market, it is hard for the beerlovers to assess the quality of a beer and it is hard for breweries and pubs to inform the beerlover of the quality of their offer. Supply chain tracking is an interesting tool to improve transparency of food markets. However, standard tracking approaches are challenging in highly fragmented contexts for several reasons. In this paper, we show how it is possible to realize a blockchain-based supply chain tracking tailored for the highly fragmented sector of the Italian craft beer. We collaborated with one of the players of that market to analyze the specific problems of that context and we report the results of this analysis. We show a design that addresses those problems and might be generalized to support tracking in other highly fragmented sectors.

These electrical signals, when monitored, show both stochastic and deterministic dynamics. In this paper, we compute 11 statistical features from the rawnon-stationary plant electrical signal time series to classify the stimulus applied (causing the electrical signal). By using different discriminant analysis-based classification techniques, we successfully establish that there is enough information in the raw electrical signal to classify the stimuli. In the process, we also propose two standard features which consistently give good classification results for three types of stimuli-sodium chloride (NaCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and ozone (O3). This may facilitate reduction in the complexity involved in computing all the features for online classification of similar external stimuli in future. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Because sensors are battery powered they are highly energy constrained. Data aggregation can be used to combine data of several sensors into a single message, thus reducing sensor communication costs at the expense of message delays. Thus, the main problem of data aggregation is to balance the communication and delay costs. In this paper we study the data aggregation problem as a bicriteria optimization problem; the objectives we consider are to minimize maximum energy consumption of a sensor and a function of the maximum latency costs of a message. We consider distributed algorithms under a synchronous time model, under an asynchronous time model, and under an almost synchronous time model, where sensor clocks are synchronized up to a small drift. We use competitive analysis to assess the quality of the algorithms. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

One of the most appealing uses of NFTs is the possibility of creating and managing an NFT collection where each token regulates the ownership of a digital asset and new tokens can be minted according to some rules. In this work, we investigate the natural question of whether a digital asset could be duplicated inside a collection of NFTs. Interestingly, while intuitively uniqueness should be enforced by the use of NFTs, we observe that the existence of clones is possible according to the mainstream approaches of Ethereum (i.e., ERC-721 contracts) and Algorand (i.e., ASAs). Moreover, we have scrutinized famous NFT collections that have been built on such decentralized platforms and our findings show that, unfortunately, the uniqueness of a digital asset in a collection (e.g., the guarantee that at most one NFT is generated for the ownership of a specific digital painting) is at risk if the minter (i.e., a single point of failure) is at some point corrupted. Next, we propose a natural and simple functionality FCollNFT abstracting the management of NFT collections that, by design, does not allow clones in a collection. While in general, ERC-721 and ASAs do not securely realize FCollNFT, we discuss the design of an NFT collection that is compliant with the ERC-721 standard and at the same time realizes FCollNFT, therefore, guaranteeing by design that even a malicious minter can not introduce clones in the collection. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","ASA; Collection; ERC-721; NFT","Clone cells; ASA; Collection; Decentralised; Digital assets; Digital painting; ERC-721; Non-fungible token; Simple++; Single point; Cloning","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174447162"

We recorded electrical signals from different plants by exposing them to Sodium Chloride (NaCl), Ozone (O3) and Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4) under laboratory conditions. After applying pre-processing techniques such as filtering and drift removal, we extracted few statistical features from the acquired plant electrical signals. Using these features, combined with different classification algorithms, we used a decision tree based multi-class classification strategy to identify the three different external chemical stimuli. We here present our exploration to obtain the optimum set of ranked feature and classifier combination that can separate a particular chemical stimulus from the incoming stream of plant electrical signals. The paper also reports an exhaustive comparison of similar feature based classification using the filtered and the raw plant signals, containing the high frequency stochastic part and also the low frequency trends present in it, as two different cases for feature extraction.

The Blockchain allows us to envision the development of a decentralised Robinson list in which citizens are finally empowered to autonomously manage their choices. In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept (PoC) of a decentralised Robinson list developed with the Algorand technology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to implement a Robinson list on a blockchain technology. The PoC has been designed to support the requirements provided by Fondazione Ugo Bordoni, the manager of the Italian Robinson list. The evaluation of the PoC shows that our decentralised solution provides satisfactory performance, in terms of scalability, latency and costs, when compared to the current centralised service. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Algorand; Blockchain; Citizen empowerment; decentralised public services","Algorand; Block-chain; Centralised; Citizen empowerment; Decentralised; Decentralized public service; Proof of concept; Public services; Robinson; Trusted third parties; Blockchain","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117001631"

In previous works, Rijndael has not been considered a suitable encryption algorithm for sensor nodes because it is too slow and requires a large space in memory, a precious resource in this environment. Our implementation of Rijndael is smaller, from about 1/3 to 1/5 of the size of previous implementations. Furthermore, we observe that nowadays MAC and routing protocols for wireless sensor networks, exhibit latencies up to few seconds, and thus the few milliseconds required by Rijndael to encrypt a TinyOS message are negligible if compared to these latencies. For this reason, in our opinion the main focus on the implementation of encryption algorithms for wireless sensor networks should move from speed, to memory occupation and energy efficiency. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We show that our prefetching technique is highly beneficial only if integrated with a suitable caching algorithm.

In particular, the application we propose does not assume any centralized coordination: it transparently collects and processes user information that is accessible in any mobile phone, such as the log of calls, the list of contacts or the inbox/outbox of short messages and exchanges it with other users. This information is used to recommend new friend-ships to other users. Furthermore, the information needed to perform recommendation is collected and exchanged be- tween users in a privacy preserving way. Finally, information necessary to implement the application is exchanged trans-parently and opportunistically, by using the residual space in standard short messages occasionally exchanged between users. As a consequence, we do not ask users to change their habits in using SMS.

Such cloud services provide enhanced flexibility and additional gains, such as availability, ease of data share, and so on. This trend poses serious threats regarding the privacy of the patients and the trust that an individual must put into the healthcare system itself. Thus, there is a strong need of privacy preservation, achieved through a variety of different approaches. In this paper, we study the application of a random projection-based approach to patient data as a means to achieve two goals: (1) provably mask the identity of users under some adversarial-attack settings, (2) preserve enough information to allow for aggregate data analysis and application of machine-learning techniques. As far as we know, such approaches have not been applied and tested on medical data. We analyze the tradeoff between the loss of accuracy on the outcome of machine-learning algorithms and the resilience against an adversary. We show that random projections proved to be strong against known input/output attacks while offering high quality data, as long as the projected space is smaller than the original space, and as long as the amount of leaked data available to the adversary is limited.

Thus the knowledge of a node's neighbors over time, is a fundamental requirement for DTN nodes to exchange knowledge and messages. A typical problem in this task occurs when the neighboring nodes try to response to the neighbor discovery request initiated by a requesting node, during a fixed contention time window. In this paper a novel neighbor discovery protocol proposed for resource constraint devices (RFID tags) running according to the delay tolerant networking paradigm. The proposed protocol is based on the traditional P-Persistent CSMA algorithm, but with the addition of the sift-distribution (sift-Persistent) in order to reduce the collisions during the response phase. The proposal has been tested both in a simulator and in a real testbed under the OpenBeacon framework. Moreover, simulations and real testbed show a coherent behavior validating our proposal in the RFID context. Performance evaluations have been tested in terms of discovered neighbors. © 2013 IEEE.","Ad Hoc; DTN; Neighbour Discovery; RFID","Knowledge management; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Testbeds; Ad Hoc; Delay Tolerant Networking; DTN; Neighbor discovery; Neighbor discovery protocol; Neighboring nodes; Neighbour Discovery; Resource-constraint devices; Delay tolerant networks","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893541337"

Aim of the proposed techniques is to define broadcasting mechanisms that are simple, thus generating low overhead, energy efficient, for deployment in resource-constrained networks, and reliable, in that all the nodes receive the intended message with very high probability. The three schemes follow two different approaches for data dissemination. The first approach relies on the idea of identifying local rules for sparsifying the network topology. The resulting virtual topology is the actual structure through which broadcasting is performed. While techniques for sparsifying the network topology have been proposed before, our solution makes no use of location information. The second approach follows the line of on-line algorithms for the implementation of probabilistic flooding. In this case, the proposed algorithm has been studied analytically, which lead to asymptotic proofs that all nodes are successfully reached by the broadcast message with very high probability. A comparative performance evaluation has been performed via simulations among the three proposed techniques and a previous solution for ad hoc broadcast. We have evaluated various metrics of interests versus different nodes distributions, which include the uniform and a more realistic ""Hill distribution"" that takes into consideration certain characteristics of sensor nodes deployment in uneven areas. Our results show that the on-line approach and one of the proposed virtual topology-based solutions offer the desirable compromise between energy saving, network load and reliability.

We consider a reference scenario where items are distributed in a shop (e.g. a bookstore or a supermarket) and are tagged with such a device (e.g. RFID). We do not assume any cooperation among users and, more importantly, we assume that each device stores only aggregate information over the histories of users that visited the item in the past. Information exchange among nodes is thus mediated by users collective and unpredictable navigation patterns. Our algorithms do not require any explicit interaction among users and can be easily and efficiently implemented. We analyze the theoretical behavior of our recommendation strategies and assess their performance in practice, both by simulation using synthetic data and on real, publicly available datasets. ©2012 CRL Publishing Ltd.","","Collaborative filtering; Computational capability; Data sets; Experimental analysis; Information exchanges; Limited communication; Navigation patterns; Pervasive systems; Recommendation techniques; Synthetic data; Intelligent systems","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84865264391"

Queue management orders and manages the messages in the node's buffer, forwarding selects the mes- sages to be delivered when there is a contact and finally replication bounds the number of replicas in the network. Contrary to most previous papers, where either only qual- itative comparisons have been presented or only a single category of protocols have been analysed, in our work we discuss the results of our experimental activity on many of the DTN protocols in the literature.

Later on, Algorand claimed to have resolved Buterin's blockchain Trilemma and is nowadays increasingly adopted by designers of decentralized computations. Motivated by the need of selecting a blockchain to run some decentralized computations, we observe the limitations of using the Trilemma as benchmark, and we propose as alternative a Quadrilemma that takes into account also computational effectiveness, namely the capability of running non-trivial decentralized computations at affordable costs. For concreteness, motivated by the current trends of using blockchains for the management of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) related to highly desired items (i.e., NFTs for art), we consider the use case of decentralized auctions in various scenarios that mainly differ on the desired degree of confidentiality. Our contribution gives the following insights. Except very limited cases where also Bitcoin can be taken into account (i.e., when latency is not a big deal and only notarization is required), Algorand can often be the right choice as long as decentralized computations consist of basic operations only. Instead, Ethereum is advisable when more sophisticated computations are required, in particular when ad-hoc cryptographic tasks are essential, and one can afford the involved costs and latency. Focusing on those three blockchains, the state of affairs about resolving the blockchain Quadrilemma is somewhat unsatisfying. Even in natural cases where computations and storage requirements for a smart contract are low (e.g., public-key encryption), none of those decentralized computers achieves simultaneously low cost and fast transaction confirmations.  © 2021 IEEE.","Auctions; Comparisons; Computational Effectiveness; Decentralized Computations; Quadrilemma","Ethereum; Public key cryptography; 'current; Basic operation; Block-chain; Comparison; Computational effectiveness; Decentralisation; Decentralised; Decentralized computation; Non-trivial; Quadrilemma; Blockchain","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123176940"

In this paper, a surveillance system based on an integration of interactive and non-interactive heterogeneous sensors is described. As a difference with respect to traditional, pure vision-based systems, the proposed approach relies on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags carried by people, multiple mobile robots (each one equipped with a laser range finder and an RFID reader), and fixed RGBD cameras. The main task of the system is to assess the presence and the position of people in the environment. This is obtained by suitably integrating data coming from heterogeneous sensors, including those mounted on board of mobile robots that are in charge of patrolling the environment. The robots also adapt their behavior according to the current situation, on the basis of a Prey-Predator scheme.

Because sensors are battery powered they are highly energy constrained. Data aggregation can be used to combine data of several sensors into a single message, thus reducing sensor communication costs at the expense of message delays. Thus, the main problem of data aggregation is to balance the communication and delay costs. In this paper we study the data aggregation problem as a bicriteria optimization problem; the objectives we consider are to minimize maximum energy consumption of a sensor and a function of the maximum latency costs of a message. We consider distributed algorithms under an asynchronous time model, and under an almost synchronous time model, where sensor clocks are synchronized up to a small drift.

In decentralized applications based on blockchains, it is desirable for the IdM to be decentralized as well. In certain applications, it is paramount to be certain that an endpoint actually belong to a specific subject. Currently, when this is needed, endpoints are either verified by who needs it, which is impractical in blockchain-based applications, or by a centralized authority, which contrasts with the spirit of the blockchain.In this paper, we show two layer-two blockchain-based protocols to prove the association between a subject and an endpoint in a decentralized manner.

The uncontrolled growth of internet-centered services has led us to accept many compromises about how we share it. In the era of Internet of Things, personal data is collected continuously.

What makes the development of such system challenging is that the concept of smartness for elderly brings to the extreme the idea of invisibility of the technology. In our experience, elders are well-disposed to new technologies, provided that those will not require significant changes - namely, they are invisible - to their habits. Starting from this consideration, 200 caregivers responses were collected by questionnaire, so as to better understand elders' needs and habits. A system was subsequently developed allowing elders to access a number of ""modern web services"" as standard TV channels: at channel 43 there is the health status, at channel 45 the photos of the family, at 46 the agenda of the week, just to mention few of the available services. The content of such services is automatically generated by the smart devices in the environment and is managed by the caregivers (e.g., family members) by simple web apps. Fourteen families were asked to install the system in their house. The results of these experiments confirm that the proposed system is considered effective and user-friendly by elders. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Currently, this service is provided in a centralized way but in 2021, the Italian Society of Authors and Editors (SIAE) deployed a blockchain-based solution to completely decentralize this database to (a) provide greater guarantees to the rights holders as well as end users and (b) make a first tangible step in the path towards an all in-chain solution decentralizing a relevant component of the current architecture. This solution relied on early versions of Algorand smart contracts, delegating some off-chain verification to trusted third parties in many practical scenarios. Moreover, the Algorand technology has developed new tools, allowing us to design new techniques to reduce some of the trust assumptions of the original solution and enhance its efficiency at the same time.

More specifically, the target is to predict the characteristics of the input light stimulus (in terms of on-off timing, duration and intensity) from the measured electrical response-leading to an inverse problem. We explored two major classes of system estimators to develop dynamical models-linear and nonlinear-and their several variants for establishing a forward and also an inverse relationship between the light stimulus and plant electrical response. The best class of models are given by the Nonlinear Hammerstein-Wiener (NLHW) estimator showing good data fitting results over other linear and nonlinear estimators in a statistical sense. Consequently, a few set of models using different functional variants of NLHW has been developed and their accuracy in detecting the on-off timing and intensity of the input light stimulus are compared for 19 independent plant datasets (including 2 additional species viz. Zamioculcas zamiifolia and Cucumis sativus) under similar experimental scenario. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we discuss the possibility of exploiting Genetic Algorithms, namely algorithms that mimic the mechanisms behind the evolution of live beings, for the implementation of a simple tool for the collaborative and participatory design of public art products that assume no technical background of the users thus better supporting the democratization of the design process. This concept has been initially tested in the context of artisan products during the Maker-Faire festival, likely the most celebrated event in makerspaces, with the main purpose of understanding the ability of the proposed process of actually engage citizens. This experiment has actively involved 369 participants, a number not negligible in experiments requiring the physical participation of users. Results from this trial suggest that this process actually leads, by evolution generation after generation, to the selection of a population of three dimensional products that are better appreciated by end users in average. Although the initial conclusions of this study, on the evolution of the products over the generations, cannot be generalized, the study does provide some initial valid feedback, as first steps of a discussion on the use of generative algorithms in art products.

The proposed protocols are designed to work under very low duty cycle operations and are jointly optimized for improved efficiency. Routing towards the sink is achieved by exploiting hop count information which is proactively distributed during the interest dissemination phase. Node densities are locally and dynamically estimated at each node and exploited at the MAC layer by means of a cost based probabilistic scheme. A cross-layer routing/MAC scheme is defined where relays to the sink are selected based on nodes' resources (including energy and queue occupancy).

Today, there is a large variety of hardware and software to choose from that is easy to set up and use. Even though there is an increasing number of real-world applications that employ large deployments of IoT devices, the wireless nature of communication in combination with the low-end capabilities of the devices raises security and privacy issues that have not been properly addressed. Considering also that sensor node brands are very different in their capabilities, providing a single solution is very challenging. In this paper we adopt Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) as an attractive alternative to conventional public key cryptography, such as RSA. ECC is an ideal candidate for implementation on constrained devices where the major computational resources, i.e., speed, memory are limited and low-power wireless communication protocols are employed. That is because it attains the same security levels with traditional cryptosystems using smaller parameter sizes. We provide a generic implementation of ECC that runs on different host operating systems, such as Contiki, TinyOS, iSenseOS, ScatterWeb and Arduino. Furthermore, it runs on smartphone platforms such as Android and iPhone and also any linux based systems (e.g., raspberryPi). Our implementation does not contain any platform-specific specializations, allowing a single implementation to run natively on heterogeneous networks. We look into the Smart Parking application domain and provide a solution that protects the privacy of the users by totally avoiding the exchange of confidential information. We also show how to protect a user's privacy by adapting the tool of zero knowledge proofs (ZKP) with our ECC implementation. We study the performance of our system in an real-world outdoor IoT testbed and analyze the execution time and network overhead for each available hardware platform.

Traditional centralized solutions face limitations in adapting to the dynamic nature of supply chains. This calls for distributed solutions which break the usual architectural assumption to have a central entity in charge of collecting, integrating and offering tools for the analysis. This project, embedded in a larger initiative called MICS, proposes an inno-vative distributed monitoring solution integrating blockchain for a trustworthy and efficient data analytics strategy that preserves data sovereignty in complex collaborative environments. Leveraging the cloud -edge continuum, the solution aims to ensure secure data exchange, adherence to agreements, and real-time analytics. Expected outcomes include an innovative federated architecture, 5G slice management solutions, an adversarial analysis of supply chain security, and a proof-of-concept implementation of the blockchain-based data flow tracking system. These developments aim to enhance the reliability, security, and efficiency of supply chain monitoring in dynamic industrial environments. © 2024 IEEE.","Blockchain-based Solution; Federated Data Analytics; Supply Chain Monitoring; Trusted Data Sharing","Block-chain; Blockchain-based solution; Business Process; Circular economy; Data analytics; Data Sharing; Federated data analytic; Supply chain monitoring; Sustainable economy; Trusted data sharing","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218627762"

With the development of the blockchain technology hosting this solution, Algorand, we can design techniques that reduce some trust assumptions of the solution developed by SIAE, enhancing at the same time its efficiency.

In the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) community, adapting technology to human nature is the key concern of User-Centered Design (UCD). However, UCD tends to neglect the emerging social dimension of technology: users are consulted in the design process, but they do not have any direct involvement or creative control over the developed technological solutions. On the other hand, the collaborative and social nature of the design process is getting increasingly explicit in the Product Design community, where well-established participatory approaches are applied to involve stakeholders, designers, and end-users in the creative process of new products. In this paper, we first provide a deep analysis of the state of the art of participatory approaches in the research literature. Then, we investigate how their integration with UCD leads not only to empower the role of end-users as active collaborators of designers towards a more democratic crowd-based UCD process,  but also to create innovation in the design process. We advocate that such innovation can be obtained by giving the right voice not only to the users who reach consensus in the design process but also to the marginals. We provide an explorative model, some experiments, and a sketch of the user interface to support our claim. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Product design; Social sciences computing; Software design; User interfaces; Creative control; Creative process; Information and communications technology; Participatory approach; Social dimensions; State of the art; Technological solution; User Centered Design(UCD); User centered design","Article","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084323656"

We first evaluate the accuracy of Cell-ID in urban, suburban and highway scenarios (both in U.S. and Italy), we then introduce the concepts of discovery-accuracy and discovery-noise to estimate the impact of positioning accuracy on the quality of resource discovery services.

This information is used to recommend new friendships to other users. Furthermore, the information needed to perform recommendation is collected and exchanged between users in a privacy preserving way. Finally, information necessary to implement the application is exchanged transparently and opportunistically, by using the residual space in standard short messages occasionally exchanged between users.

This paper presents a protocol for the management of electronic identities (eIDs), meant as a substitute for the paper-based IDs, in a mobile environment with a user-centric approach. Mobile devices have been chosen because they provide mobility, personal use and high computational complexity. The inherent user-centricity also allows the user to personally manage the ID information and to display only what is required. The chosen path to develop the protocol is to migrate the existing eCert technologies implemented by the Learning Societies Laboratory in Southampton. By comparing this protocol with the analysis of the eID problem domain, a new solution has been derived which is compatible with both systems without loss of features. © 2011 WorldCIS.","","Computational complexity; Environmental management; Internet; Internet protocols; Mobile devices; Security of data; Telecommunication networks; Word processing; Electronic document; Electronic identity; Mobile environments; New solutions; Personal use; Private information; Problem domain; User-centric; Electronic document exchange","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79955926741"

Several scenarios (e.g., selling images over the Internet, fighting disinformation, detecting deep fakes) would highly benefit from systems allowing to verify that an image is the result of a transformation applied to a confidential authentic image. In this paper, we focus on systems for proving and verifying the correctness of transformations of authentic images guaranteeing: 1) confidentiality (i.e., the original image remains private), 2) efficient proof generation (i.e., the proof certifying the correctness of the transformation can be computed with a common laptop) even for high-resolution images, 3) authenticity (i.e., only the advertised transformations have been applied) and 4) fast detection of fraud proofs.. Our contribution consists of new definitions modelling confidentiality and adaptive adversaries, techniques to speed up the prover of a ZK-snark, an efficient construction relying on ad-hoc signatures and hashes, and a less efficient construction that works according to signatures and hashes included in the C2PA specifications. Experimental results confirm the viability of our approach, allowing to compute an authentic transformation of a high-resolution image on a common computer.

Data aggregation is a possible way to save energy consumption: nodes may delay data in order to aggregate them into a single packet before forwarding them towards some central node (sink). However, many applications impose constraints on the maximum delay of data; this translates into latency constraints for data arriving at the sink. We study the problem of data aggregation to minimize maximum energy consumption under latency constraints on sensed data delivery, and we assume unique communication paths that form an intree rooted at the sink. We prove that the offline problem is strongly NP-hard and we design a 2-approximation algorithm. The latter uses a novel rounding technique. Almost all real-life sensor networks are managed online by simple distributed algorithms in the nodes. In this context we consider both the case in which sensor nodes are synchronized or not. We assess the performance of the algorithm by competitive analysis. We also provide lower bounds for the models we consider, in some cases showing optimality of the algorithms we propose. Most of our results also hold when minimizing the total energy consumption of all nodes. © 2009 ACM.","Competitive analysis; Data aggregation; Distributed algorithms; Wireless sensor networks","Approximation algorithms; Computational complexity; Data handling; Electric load forecasting; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication equipment; Wireless telecommunication systems; Communication path; Competitive analysis; Data aggregation; Data delivery; Distributed algorithm; Distributed algorithms; Energy consumption; Energy-constrained; Latency constraints; Lower bounds; Maximum delay; Off-line problems; Optimality; Save energy; Sensing devices; Strongly NP-hard; Total energy consumption; Wireless communications; Wireless sensor networks","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-74049128688"

Data aggregation is a possible way to save energy consumption: nodes may delay data in order to aggregate them into a single packet before forwarding them towards some central node (sink). However, many applications impose constraints on data freshness; this translates into latency constraints for data arriving at the sink. We study the problem of data aggregation to minimize maximum energy consumption under latency constraints on sensed data delivery and we assume unique transmission paths that form a tree rooted at the sink. We prove that the off-line problem is strongly NP-hard and we design a 2-approximation algorithm. The latter uses a novel rounding technique. Almost all real life sensor networks are managed on-line by simple distributed algorithms in the nodes. In this context we consider both the case in which sensor nodes are synchronized or not. We consider distributed on-line algorithms and use competitive analysis to assess their performance. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.","","Algorithms; Computer networks; Constraint theory; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Energy utilization; Mobile computing; Problem solving; Data aggregation; Data deliveries; Energy constrained; Sensor networks; Sensor data fusion","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33750704277"

In this highly fragmented market, it is hard for the beerlovers to assess the quality of a beer and it is hard for breweries and pubs to inform the beerlover of the quality of their offer. Supply chain tracking is an interesting tool to improve transparency of food markets. However, standard tracking approaches are challenging in highly fragmented contexts for several reasons. In this paper, we show how it is possible to realize a blockchain-based supply chain tracking tailored for the highly fragmented sector of the Italian craft beer. We collaborated with one of the players of that market to analyse the specific problems of that context and we report the results. We show a design that addresses those problems and might be generalized to support tracking in other highly fragmented sectors. We estimate costs and that turn out to be affordable for that sector.

As a difference with respect to traditional, passive and pure vision-based systems, the proposed approach relies on a distributed sensor network combining RFID tags, multiple mobile robots, and fixed RGBD cameras. The presence and the position of people in the scene is detected by suitably combining data coming from the sensor nodes, including those mounted on board of the mobile robots that are in charge of patrolling the environment. The robots can adapt their behavior according to the current situation, on the basis of a Prey-Predator scheme, and can coordinate their actions to fulfill the required tasks.

The absence of a general solution for managing a cross-chain identity can cause fragmentation, leading to the possibility of realizing applications that are more prone to security bugs. In this paper, we propose a framework to build a cross-chain identity based on the principles and standards of a new identity management paradigm, i.e., Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Promoting the standardization of applications running on the blockchain enhances their security and encourages the adoption of this technology in an increasing number of application contexts. According to the SSI paradigm, users create and update their identities in a blockchain without intermediaries. Following this principle, our framework does not require intermediaries to transfer identity-associated data from a source blockchain to a target blockchain. We realize that using a blockchain relay, an interoperability solution for storing and validating the headers of the source blockchain on the target blockchain. In our paper, we provide a new relay, the StateRelay, reducing the final usage costs for users willing to realize a cross-chain identity. We will show this by comparing its costs, in terms of transaction fees, with the other relay solutions in the literature.  © 2023 IEEE.","Blockchain Interoperability; Blockchain Relay; Cross-chain identity; Self-Sovereign Identity","Interoperability; Program debugging; Block-chain; Blockchain interoperability; Blockchain relay; Cross-chain identity; General solutions; Identity management; Identity-based; Security bugs; Self-sovereign identity; Blockchain","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172887014"

Our first proposed technique, called the Irrigator protocol, relies on the idea to first build a sparse overlay network, and then flood over it. The overlay network is set up by means of a simple, distributed, localized probabilistic protocol and spans all the sensor nodes with high probability. Based on the algorithmic ideas of the Irrigator protocol we then develop a second protocol, dubbed Fireworks, with similar performance that does not require any overlay network to be set up in advance. Asymptotic analytical results are provided which assess the reliability of the Irrigator and Fireworks techniques. The theoretical analysis of the proposed protocols is complemented and validated by a (simulation based) comparative performance evaluation that assesses several advantages of our new protocols with respect to gossiping and simple flooding. Differently from previous studies, we analyze and demonstrate the performance of our protocols for two different node distributions: The typical uniform distribution and a newly defined ""hill"" distribution, here introduced to capture some of the important and more realistic aspects of node deployment in heterogeneous terrain. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes achieve very good trade-offs between low overhead, low energy consumption and high reliability. In particular, the Irrigator and Fireworks protocols are more reliable than gossiping, and significantly reduce the number of links along which a message is sent over both flooding and gossiping. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Ad hoc networks; Broadcasting; Gossiping; Sensor networks","Ad hoc networks; Broadcasting; Energy utilization; Network protocols; Probabilistic logics; Gossiping; Overlay networks; Probabilistic protocols; Wireless sensor networks","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-36949013243"

However, it is nowadays clear that the success of a smart city largely depends on the level of engagement of its citizens. In this paper we explore to what extent disruptive blockchain technologies can be used to incentivise the democratic participation of citizen. The investigated approach extends the standard IoT cycle 1) sense data, 2) cloudify and elaborate them, and 3) push information to the users. Here, the user takes an active role by means of data-informed votes on policies, therefore influencing behaviours. We illustrate such an approach by means of a proof-of-concept decentralised application (dApp) supporting the negotiation of polices for the management of urban water resources. The dApp consists of a smart contract that manages the execution of other smart contracts (the policies) according to the data-driven choices of the community. This use case demonstrates how suitably blockchain technologies can support fair and safe access to data and user engagement in smart cities. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain technologies; DApps; IoT; Smart cities; Smart Contracts","Blockchain; Smart city; Water management; DApps; Decentralised; Democratic participation; Information and Communication Technologies; Proof of concept; Urban services; Urban water resources; User engagement; Internet of things","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079342566"

This is due to the fact that the Bluetooth hardware we used, does not fully support some critical non mandatory features of the Bluetooth specifications which could instead be exploited to significantly improve the overall performance This experimental study provides important insights on the importance of a full implementation of the Bluetooth specification to improve scatternet formation efficiency in real systems.","","Computer simulation; Real time systems; Telecommunication links; Scatternet formation efficiency; Bluetooth","Conference paper","","Scopus","2-s2.0-35148820610"
